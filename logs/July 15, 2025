Got back home late, so couldn’t do much
Watched a Simulink tutorial video
Set up my Simulink account
Looked over some Arduino tutorials

Some days are be like this but what matters is that I’m still connected and ready to go again tomorrow

**Next steps**
Dive deeper into Simulink tomorrow (try building a small model)
Possibly start writing out robot ideas

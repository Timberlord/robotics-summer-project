Created my GitHub repo: [robotics-summer-project]
Set up the folder structure (code/, designs/, logs/)
Talked through my current doubts, motivations, and goals for the summer

Reflections
I’m realizing that I don’t have to have everything figured out to start — I just have to *start*. This repo is a real step forward, hopefully.
Still not sure exactly what field of robotics I want to focus on yet, but I do know that I want to build things with my hands

Still waiting on hardware deliveries, but I don’t want that to stop me. Gonna check out simulink and figure out its usage.

Next Steps
Brainstorm potential robot ideas (line follower? maze solver? obstacle-avoider?)
Watch Arduino tutorials
Reach out to a robotics startup about shadowing or work experience
Keep journaling daily, even if it's just one paragraph

Mindset
Progress over perfection.

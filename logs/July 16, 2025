Off Day
Didn't get any work done today
Kinda realized how easy it is to let a slow day cascade into the next one

Reflections
Momentum is fragile.
Gonna treat this as a reset point

Next Steps
Regain momentum tomorrow: C programming, Arduino, or Simulink
Log consistently even on light days. It keeps the project grounded

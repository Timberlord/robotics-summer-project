# Robotics Summer Project 2025

## Overview
This is a robotics project that I’m building over the summer as part of my personal exploration into engineering. I’m especially focused on hands-on building, learning embedded C/C++ programming, and understanding the mechanics behind robotics.

## Project Goal
- Build a simple prototype robot/system
- Gain insight into real-world engineering (mechanics, control, and electronics)
- Get better at programming with C/C++ and documenting my process

## Why This Project?
I’ve always been passionate about robotics, and this project is my step forward — from interest to actual experience. This is simply a personal project and growth space.

## Current Status
- Created GitHub repo and started documenting
- Waiting on hardware deliveries
- Testing small parts of code and planning design
- Journaling daily/weekly logs and thoughts

## Folder Structure
- code/: Arduino / C code
- designs/: sketches, diagrams
- logs/: daily/weekly thoughts, updates, challenges

## Timeline
| Week | Plan |

| 1 | Repo setup, part research, initial ideas |

| 2 | Begin writing code + start logging |

| 3–5 | Hardware arrives → build + test |

| 6–8 | Polish design, finalize documentation |
